#To run this program you will need Python 3. Just download the latest version from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ I could not figure out how to make this an executable and it sounds like a lot of work. Just open IDLE (Python 3.XX 64-bit). Select File, then Open and then navigate to the unzipped file you downloaded that contains this readme and select main.py. Should work now.
